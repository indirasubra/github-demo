Momentos Learning Enhancement System for University and College Students</h1>

<h2 class="ui header">
What is Momentos?</h2>
Momentos is a self-serve, student-driven, instructor-controlled Learning Enhancement System (LES) that offers an easily accessible, inexpensive classroom lecture capture and an AI-driven service to improve learning outcomes for university and college students. The existing solutions for lecture capture and enhancement are not easily accessible to every classroom in colleges and universities. Furthermore they do not adequately exploit the advances in modern technologies that are becoming both inexpensive and increasingly commoditized. We believe that with advanced technologies, significant additional improvement in learning outcomes is possible in both flipped classrooms and conventional ones.

How Does Momentos Work?</h2>
In any course, a  student can record a classroom lecture with permission from the instructor and upload it to the Momentos LES. Alternatively, an instructor can request a TA or a student to record the lecture via Momentos. The recording TA or student uses the Momentos smartphone app to record the course lectures. Subsequently, students enrolled in the class are able to access the lectures along with the AI-driven features of Momentos.

        <div class="active content">
                <p>The lecture recording is typically the Intellectual Property (IP) of the instructors that delivered the lecture. Once a student completes the video recording of a lecture using the Momentos recording app (iOS and Android versions are available), the video is uploaded automatically to the Momentos backend of EITR Systems, Inc., the maker of the Momentos product. By agreeing to use Momentos for the course, the IP owner grants the right to Momentos to  (a) host the video lectures and (b) make these videos accessible to users who were authorized by the IP owner.</p>

        <div class="active content">
                <p>Momentos allows students enrolled in a course to access the recorded lectures exclusively through the Momentos web interface.  Recorded lectures cannot be downloaded by anyone from the Momentos website.</p>

        <div class="active content">
                <p>Recorded lectures will be accessible only as long as designated by the course instructors. Typically an instructor would want lectures to be accessible up until the finals and require that the lectures be taken down immediately after the finals. Some instructors instead could choose to make the lectures accessible for a longer duration based on their preferences.  This decision is entirely up to the course instructors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="active content">
                <p>With Momentos, students will be able to give undivided attention to the instructor’s lecture in the classroom. They may intermittently take personal notes if desired for reference later. After the class, they will be able to revisit the video recordings and access targeted points in the lecture video using keyword search of transcription provided by Momentos.</p>

                What benefits does Momentos offer to instructors?
        </div>
        <div class="active content">
                <p>First, since students have the ability to revisit the lecture using Momentos video recordings and they can do focused learning using search, they can learn more effectively and efficiently. Second, Momentos offers data analysis on how students are using the recordings thereby providing key insights for instructors and Universities. Using these insights, instructors could organize future lecture content placing emphasis on concepts that are relatively challenging to the students. With students learning better through Momentos, instructors will need to spend less time in open office hours.</p>

                What benefits does Momentos offer to Teaching Assistants (TAs)?
        </div>
        <div class="active content">
                <p>Since students have the ability to revisit the lecture using Momentos video recordings and they can do focused learning using search, they can learn more effectively and efficiently.  Momentos therefore is essentially a TA’s assistant in helping students do well in a course. TAs can use their time to broaden the scope of helping students --- inspire and help students above and beyond the classroom to make them better learners.</p>
